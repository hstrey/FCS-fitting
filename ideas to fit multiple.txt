how to do multiple fits with common parameters?
one x
several y's
some fitting parameters are common to all datasets
some (fitting) parameters are not

Can be generalized for several x, several y

If x is 1-d array x is used for all. If x is array then each y row is associated with x.
If y is 2-d array it is a multiple data set fit

Input should be lists of np.array()
